Introduction to Event Monitoring
================================

Event monitoring provides event data reporting, query, and alarm reporting. You can create alarm rules for both system and custom events. When specific events occur, Cloud Eye generates alarms for you.

Events are key operations on database resources that are stored and monitored by Cloud Eye. You can view events to see operations performed by specific users on specific resources, for example, changing instance specifications.

Event monitoring provides an API for reporting custom events, which helps you collect and report abnormal events or important change events generated by services to Cloud Eye.

Event monitoring is enabled by default. You can view monitoring details about system events and custom events. For details about system events, see :ref:`Supported Events <opengauss_events>`.
