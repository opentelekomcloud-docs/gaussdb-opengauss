Scenarios
=========

-  Transaction applications

   The distributed, highly scalable architecture of GaussDB makes it an ideal fit for highly concurrent online transactions containing a large volume of data from government, finance, e-commerce, O2O, telecom customer relationship management (CRM), and billing. GaussDB supports different deployment models.

-  CDR query

   GaussDB can process petabytes of data and use the memory analysis technology to query massive volumes of data when data is being written to databases. Therefore, it is suitable for the Call Detail Record (CDR) query service in the security, telecom, finance, and Internet of things (IoT) sectors.
